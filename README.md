# Reddit-Clipper

Just some code i wrote for reddit using the PRAW wrapper to download video files, group them and create a 10 ish minute video.
It works but considering the new api fee, was a mistake.
This project was only for learning apis, using the requests library and getting some experience.
Not meant to be perfect, but is functional
